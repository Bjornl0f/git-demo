Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside

Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, are they right, yes, by who's to say?


For a hill men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test there their pride

Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
